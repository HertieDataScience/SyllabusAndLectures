## <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-up"></i> Objectives for the week

- Collaborative Research Project

- Next Class

- Review

- Static maps with ggmap

- Dynamic results presentation

    + Static website hosting with gh-pages


## Collaborative Research Project (1)

**Purposes**: Pose an interesting research question and try to answer it using
data analysis and standard academic practices. Effectively communicate your
results to a **variety of audiences** in a **variety of formats**.

**Deadline**:

- Presentation: In-class Monday 2 May

- Website/Paper: 13 May 2016

## Collaborative Research Project (2)

The project can be thought of as a 'dry run' for your thesis with multiple
presentation outputs.

Presentation: 10 minutes **maximum**. **Engagingly** present your research
question and key findings to a general academic audience (fellow students).

Paper: 5,000 words maximum. **Standard academic paper**, properly cited laying out
your research question, literature review, data, methods, and findings.

Website: An engaging website designed to convey your research to **a general
audience**.

## Collaborative Research Project (3)

Project total: 50% of your final mark.

- 10% presentation

- 10% website

- 30% paper

## Collaborative Research Project (4)

As always, you should **submit one GitHub repository** with all of the
materials needed to **completely reproduce** your data gathering, analysis, and
presentation documents.

**Note**: Because you've had two assignments already to work on parts of the
project, I expect **high quality work**.

## Collaborative Research Project (5)

Find one other group to be a **discussant** for your presentation.

The discussants will provide a quick (max 2 minute) critique of your
presentation--ideas for things you can improve on your paper--pose questions.

## Office hours

I will have normal office hours every week for the
rest of the term.

Please take advantages of this opportunity to **improve your final project**.

**Be prepared.**

## Review

- What is the data-ink ratio? Why is it important for effective plotting.

- Why should you avoid using the **size** of circles to have meaning about
continuous variables?

- Why not use red-green colour contrasts to indicate contrasting data?

- How many decimal places should you report in a table and why?

## ggmap

Last class we didn't have time to cover mapping with ggmap.

We've already seen how ggmap can be used to find latitude and longitude.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggmap)

places <- c('Bavaria', 'Seoul', '6 Pariser Platz, Berlin')

geocode(places)
```

## ggmap: get the map

```{r, message=FALSE}
qmap(location = 'Berlin', zoom = 15)
```

## Plot Houston crime with ggmap

Example from:
[Kahle and Wickham (2013)](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/kahle-wickham.pdf)

Use *crime* data set that comes with ggmap

```{r}
names(crime)
```

## Clean data

```{r message=FALSE}
# find a reasonable spatial extent
qmap('houston', zoom = 13) # gglocator(2) see in RStudio
```

## Clean data

```{r}
# only violent crimes
violent_crimes <- subset(crime,
    offense != "auto theft" & offense != "theft" &
    offense != "burglary")

# order violent crimes
violent_crimes$offense <- factor(violent_crimes$offense,
    levels = c("robbery", "aggravated assault", "rape", "murder"))

# restrict to downtown
violent_crimes <- subset(violent_crimes,
                    -95.39681 <= lon & lon <= -95.34188 &
                    29.73631 <= lat & lat <= 29.78400)
```

## Plot crime data

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Set up base map
HoustonMap <- qmap("houston", zoom = 14,  
                   source = "stamen", maptype = "toner")

# Add points
FinalMap <- HoustonMap +
                geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat, colour = offense),
                data = violent_crimes) +
                xlab('') + ylab('') +
                theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
                      axis.text.x = element_blank(),
                      axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
                guides(size = guide_legend(title = 'Offense'),
                       colour = guide_legend(title = 'Offense'))
```

---

```{r, warning=FALSE}
print(FinalMap)
```

## Interactive visualisations

When your output documents are in **HTML**, you can create interactive
visualisations.

Potentially more engaging and could let users explore data on their own.

## Interactive visualisations

Big distinction:

**Client Side**: Plots are created on the user's (client's) computer. Often
**JavaScript in the browser**. You simply send them static HTML/JavaScript needed for
their browser to create the plots.

**Server Side**: Data manipulations and/or plots (e.g. with Shiny Server) are
done on a **server in R**. Browsers don't come with R built in.

## Hosting

There are lots of **free** services (e.g. GitHub Pages) for hosting webpages for
client side plot rendering.

You usually have to use a **paid** service for server side data manipulation
plotting.

## Server Side Applications

You can use R to (relatively) easily create server side web applications with R.

To do this use [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/).

We are not going to cover Shiny in the class as it usually requires a paid service
to host.

## Set up for Creating Websites with Client Side Visualisations

You already know how to create HTML documents with **R Markdown**.

Set your code chunk to `results='asis'` (not needed for some packages).

There is a growing set of tools for interactive plotting, e.g.:

- [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/)

- [googleVis](https://code.google.com/p/google-motion-charts-with-r/)

- [dygraphs](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

- [rcharts](http://rcharts.io/)

- [networkD3](http://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/)

## Caveat

<br>
<br>

These packages simply create an interface between R and (usually) JavaScript.

Debugging often requires some knowledge of JavaScript and the
[DOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model).

In sum: usually simple, but can be mysteriously difficult without a good
knowledge of JavaScript/HTML.

## ggplot2 and plotly

The [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) package allows you to convert (most) ggplot2 plots to JavaScript.

Simply create your ggplot2 object, then pass it to `ggplotly`.

Using an example from last class:

```{r include=FALSE}
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)

source_url("http://bit.ly/OTWEGS")

# Create data with no missing values of infant mortality
InfantNoMiss <- subset(MortalityGDP,
                           !is.na(InfantMortality))

# Create High/Low Income Variable
InfantNoMiss$DumMort[InfantNoMiss$InfantMortality
                     >= 15] <- "high"
InfantNoMiss$DumMort[InfantNoMiss$InfantMortality
                     < 15] <- "low"
```

```{r}
mort_plot <- ggplot(data = MortalityGDP, aes(x = InfantMortality,
        y = GDPperCapita)) + geom_point()
```

Then . . .

---

```{r results='asis', message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
ggplotly(mort_plot)
```

## Or use only plotly

```{r}
plot_ly(MortalityGDP, x = InfantMortality, y = GDPperCapita,
        mode = 'markers')
```

## `ggplotly` works with simGLM

```{r include=FALSE}
library(simGLM) # if not installed use devtools::github_install('christophergandrud/simGLM')

# Download data
URL <- 'http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv'
Admission <- read.csv(URL)
Admission$rank <- as.factor(Admission$rank)

# Estimate model
m2 <- glm(admit ~ gre + gpa + rank, data = Admission, family = 'binomial')

# Create fitted values
fitted_admit <- expand.grid(gre = seq(220, 800, by = 10), gpa = c(1, 4), 
                            rank4 = 1)

# Simulate and plot
sim_gpa <- sim_glm(obj = m2, newdata = fitted_admit, model = 'logit', x_coef = 'gre', 
                   group_coef = 'gpa') + theme_bw(base_size = 9)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# sim_gpa created with http://hertiedatascience.github.io/Examples/
ggplotly(sim_gpa)
```

## Google Plots with googleVis

The googleVis package can create Google plots from R.

Example modified from
[googleVis Vignettes](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleVis/vignettes/googleVis_examples.html).

```{r}
# Create fake data
fake_compare <- data.frame(
                country = c("2010", "2011", "2012"),
                US = c(10,13,14),
                GB = c(23,12,32))
```

## googleVis simple example

```{r, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(googleVis)
line_plot <- gvisLineChart(fake_compare)
print(line_plot, tag = 'chart')
```

**Note**: To show in interactive R use `plot` instead of `print` and don't include
`tag = 'chart'`.

## Choropleth map with googleVis

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(WDI)
co2 <- WDI(indicator = 'EN.ATM.CO2E.PC', start = 2010, end = 2010)
co2 <- co2[, c('iso2c','EN.ATM.CO2E.PC')]

# Clean
names(co2) <- c('iso2c', 'CO2 Emissions per Capita')
co2[, 2] <- round(log(co2[, 2]), digits = 2)

# Plot
co2_map <- gvisGeoChart(co2, locationvar = 'iso2c',
                      colorvar = 'CO2 Emissions per Capita',
                      options = list(
                          colors = "['#fff7bc', '#d95f0e']"
                          ))
```

---

CO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita)

```{r, results='asis'}
print(co2_map, tag = 'chart')
```

## More Examples

<br>
<br>
<br>

More examples are available at:
<http://HertieDataScience.github.io/Examples/>

## Hosting a website on GitHub Pages

Any file called *index.html* in a GitHub **repository branch** called
*gh-pages* will be a hosted website.

The URL will be:

`http://GITHUB_USER_NAME.github.io/REPO_NAME`

Note: you can use a custom URL if you own one. See
<https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/>

## Set Up GitHub Pages

First **create a new branch** in your repository called `gh-pages`:

![Create Branch](img/CreateBranch.png)

## Set Up GitHub Pages

Then **sync** your branch with the local version of the repository.

<br>

Finally **switch** to the gh-pages branch.

<img src="img/SwitchBranch.png" width=400 height=200 />

## GitHub Pages and R Markdown

You can use R Markdown to create the index.html page.

Simply place a new .Rmd file in the repository called `index.Rmd` and
knit it to HTML. Then sync it.

Your website will now be live.

Every time you *push* to the gh-pages branch, the website will be **updated**.

## Note

<br>
<br>
<br>

Note branches in git repositories can have totally different files in them.

Example: [networkD3](https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/)

## Interactive dashboards with flexdashboard

You can create interactive 'dashboards' for displaying an information overview using the [flexdashboard](http://rstudio.github.io/flexdashboard/index.html) package.

The package is not on CRAN yet, so install with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/flexdashboard")
```

## flexdashboard syntax

flexdashboard works on R Markdown. 

To set a `.Rmd` file as a flexdasboard, in the header use:

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
output: flexdashboard::flex_dashboard
```

Each element of the dashboard is delimited with the Markdown third level header: `###`.

You can create different columns and rows with:

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
Column
-------------------------------------
```

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
Row
-------------------------------------
```

## flexdashboard example 

A minimal code example is available at: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HertieDataScience/flexdashboard_example/gh-pages/index.Rmd>

The output is at: <http://hertiedatascience.github.io/flexdashboard_example/>

You can host these on Github pages as before. 

Then can also be [integrated with shiny](http://rstudio.github.io/flexdashboard/shiny.html).

## Seminar

Begin to **create a website** for your project with RMarkdown and
graphics (either static or interactive).

If relevant include:

- A table of key results

- A googleVis map

- A bar or line chart with plotly or other package

- A simulation plot created with simGLM showing key results from your regression
analysis.

Push to the gh-pages branch.
